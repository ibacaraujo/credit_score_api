# Credit Prediction API

This project provides an API to predict the creditworthiness of individuals based on demographic and financial features. It is built with Flask and uses a trained XGBoost model for classification.

---

## Description of the Problem

Predicting creditworthiness is a critical task for financial institutions to assess the risk of lending to individuals. Such predictions can be useful for:
- Loan approval processes.
- Risk assessment and management.
- Financial planning and forecasting.

This project uses the **German Credit Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to train the model. The dataset includes attributes such as age, employment status, housing, and credit amount.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+.
- Pip (Python package installer).
- Flask.
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibacaraujo/credit_prediction_api.git
cd credit_prediction_api
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Start the Flask Server

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python predict.py
```

### 5. Test the API

You can test the API using the `predict_test.py` script:

```bash
python predict_test.py
```

### 6. Example Response

The API will return a JSON response like this:

```json
{
    "credit_risk_probability": 0.85,
    "credit_score": true
}
```

## Testing the Application with Containerization

This section explains how to build, run, and test the application using Docker.

---

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the `credit_prediction_api` folder and build the Docker image using the `Dockerfile`:

```bash
cd credit_prediction_api
docker build -t credit_prediction_api .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Start a container from the built image and map it to your local machineâ€™s port:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8885:8885 credit_prediction_api
```

### 3. Test the API

#### Test with the `predict_test.py` Script

Run the `predict_test.py` script to test the containerized API:

```bash
python predict_test.py
```

### 4. Test the Deployed Web Service

You can test the deployed service using the following URL:

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a simple and effective way to deploy a machine learning model as a web service using Flask and Docker. The API provides predictions on whether an individual is creditworthy based on demographic and financial data, making it a valuable tool for various applications in the financial sector.

Feel free to explore the deployed service and use the provided Docker setup to test the application locally or on other platforms.
